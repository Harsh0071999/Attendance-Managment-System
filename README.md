# Attendance-Managment-System
An attendance management system for students is a software application that helps educators keep track of student attendance in real-time. The system allows teachers to record attendance for each class period, and the data is automatically stored in a centralized database.
This makes it easy to track attendance patterns, monitor student progress, and identify students who may need extra support.
